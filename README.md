It is a simple project to identify the food given in the image. Here, we've utilised a dataset with 101 classes, each containing 1000 images, for a total of 101,000 images. To acquire the best results from the data we gathered, the model is trained with 50 epoches. These are the outcomes of our model's training using various compilers. The local machine we utilised for training has an 8GB RAM and a Ryzen 550U processor.

The contrast above shows that training a model on a local machine takes a lot of time, which makes it hard for a student to finish. Nevertheless, by using cloud compilers like Google Colab and Intel OneApi, we substantially cut the time, making it easier and more accessible for students to learn AI and ML.
